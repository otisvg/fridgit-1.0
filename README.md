### Umm, what is this? ðŸ‘€

I'm building an application that enables users to upload and store custom recipes, each with an ingredient list associated to it.

### Goals

```
v1.00
Pure Ruby. Be able to meet MVP by interacting via IRB.

e.g. 

```

Portions: 3
Ingredients: Red Split Lentils (200g), Water (500ml) Onions (1 large), Ghee (2 tbsp), Turmeric (1 tbsp), Ground cumin (3 tspn), Oil (1 tbspn), ginger (2 thumbs)
Recipe: 1. Wash and cook lentils on medium heat using all water, oil and turmeric. 2. Chop ginger and onion to preference. 3. Heat ghee on low-medium until bubbling. 4. Add ground cumin and fry until fragrant. 5.

### What real-life problem is this solving?
